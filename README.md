# Microservices for a cinema

<p>
The microservices project for a cinema platform that tries to simulate a microservices architecture, has three microservices: movie listing services, movie address services, and movie trailer services. Each of these microservices has independent functions such as:
  
- **List movies:** Get a list of available movies containing the movie in Json format.
- **List cinemas:** obtain the addresses of cinemas that are registered in the franchise.
- **Movie trailers:** play the different movie trailers.

It should be noted that this is just a microservices project.Dockerfile and Docker-compose are also used to create Docker images.Git Actions automates the creation of images, uploading them to Docker Hub and then deploying them to EC2.
