# Microservices for a cinema

<p>
The microservices project for a cinema platform that tries to simulate a microservices architecture, has three microservices: movie trailer services, movie services and movie theater services. Each of these microservices has independent functions like listing the different cinemas, listing different movies and videos of the movies. It should be noted that this is just a project, it is just a simulation of microservices.
Dockerfile and Docker-compose are also used for creating Docker images.
